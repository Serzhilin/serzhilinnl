  # Hi hi. My name is Sergei Zhilin

  I live in Amsterdam. I'm an urban sociologist, urban commons activist, and certified wellbeing coach. My work and life explores how we can manage our cities in communities, and how we can build economies based on care, reciprocity, and purpose.

  Right now, I'm busy with several missions:

  - [Coaching](https://markcoaching.nl) individuals and groups on life, purpose, and balance

  - [Developing](https://dewoonwolk.nl) a community housing project in a housing cooperative de Woonwolk and groups on life, purpose, and balance

  - Writing a book on the urban commons in Amsterdam

  - [Promoting](https://ecommons.space) new generation of the internet for the commons

  - Co-authoring research on community economies for the City of Amsterdam
